                <h2>About Me</h2>

                <p>
                    I am just a young guy from Detroit, MI. Growing up I typically would like to play a lot of video games. If I was not in the 
                    house playing video games, I would like to be outside playing some type of sports. I primarily like to play basketball because I
                    had two older brothers that played basketball for high school and college. I am a lot younger than my brothers, but sports still managed
                    to keep us pretty close.
                </p>

                <p>
                    When I grew up, I found linked up with my wife at a job that we met and feel in love. This was very unexpected because neither of us
                    were looking to fall in love at that time. A lot of peoople say that love finds you when you are least expecting it and I find that to be 
                    very true in my case. We evetually had several beautiful kids and I am not just saying that they are beautiful because they are my kids! Lol!
                    Life has been great, but I am really looking forward to the next chapters of our lives as we continue to grow as a family.

                    I really enjoy spending time with my family. I have the most fun with my family when we are doing water events. I
                    really had a lot of fun when my wife and I went flyboarding in Florida. This was the first time and probably the last time
                    that I will ever go flyboarding because it was very scary once I actually did it. If you have never went flyboarding, you
                    basically lock your feet into a skateboard. At the bottom of the board, there are water jets that push you higher and higher into
                    the air. When you are in the air you literally have no way to break your fall and you will smack into the water each and every time. 
                    I am glad that I did this but, I do not feel the need to do this again! 
                </p>

                    There was another time that I can remember that was very fun with my family. This was a time that my wife and I took our kids to a waterpark. 
                    My daughter was finally excited to get on the taller water rides and that made me very happy. The time before this, she did not want to even look
                    at the tall water slides because she was too afraid. Of course, I would not force her to go on anything that she didnt want to get on. This time she wanted to get on
                    every tall ride. She even wanted to get on rides that were almost too tall for me, lol! My son is a lot younger and there for he was not ready to get on any of the 
                    water slides with us, but he had a blast getting in the kiddie pool. My daughter and I made sure to make sure that he had a great time as well.
